| Project name | Description | Libraries used | 
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| [Sentiment analysis: Toxic comments identification](nlp_toxic_comments) | Building a system that identifies toxic comments and sends them to be edited/viewed. Building a model that classifies comments into positive and negative.| *pandas numpy seaborn scipy datetime nltk xgboost lightgbm* | 
| [Personal data encryption](insurance) | Developing an encryption algorithm so that after data transformation, the accuracy of Machine Learning models will not change as without transformation. Building a system (ML model) on encrypted data. Creating a custom Linear Regresssion model. | *pandas numpy seaborn scipy random* |
| [Forecasting taxi orders](taxi_orders) | Buidling a system for predicting the number of taxi orders for the next hour to attract more drivers during peak periods.
