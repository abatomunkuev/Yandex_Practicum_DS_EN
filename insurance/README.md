## Data description

Data from insurance company. Each object represents the user information: gender, age, salary, family members for the last 5 years.

|Column          | Column type |
 |:---------------|:-----------|
 |Gender| feature |
 |Age| feature |
 |Salary| feature |
 |Family members| feature |
 |Insurance benefits | target |

## Task

The insurance company needs to protect user data. We need to encrypt personal information. We need to create [data encryption algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) so that after transformation, the accuracy of Machine Learning models will not change as without transformation
