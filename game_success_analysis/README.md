## Data description

Data is from open sources 2016 - historical game sales data: user and expert ratings, country sales, genres and platforms, [ESRB ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board)

- *Name* - the name of the game
- *Platform* - platform
- *Year_of_Release* - release year
- *Genre* - game genre
- *NA_sales* - sales in North America (millions of copies sold)
- *EU_sales* - sales in Europe (millions of copies sold)
- *JP_sales* - sales in Japan (millions of copies sold)
- *Other_sales* - sales in other countries (millions of copies sold)
- *Critic_Score* - critic scores (maximum 100)
- *User_Score* - user rating (maximum 10)
- *Rating* - rating by the ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board), which determines the rating of the game and the appropriate age category

## Task

We have open-source data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres ,and platforms. We need to help the global online game store to find a potentially popular product, which will allow them to plan advertising campaigns. We need to identify patterns that determine the success of the game.
